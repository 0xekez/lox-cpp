A WIP Lox implementation following along with Crafting Interpreters.
See hello.loxc for what is currently supported.

This branch records something I was thinking about where everything is
a statement. Statements just return the last value that they
evaluated. For example:

print if (true;) "dog"; else "cat";;      // prints dog

I think it introduces some flexibility, but I also figure its best to
start with something normal before branching out into strange
territory. I'll think about revisiting this later.
